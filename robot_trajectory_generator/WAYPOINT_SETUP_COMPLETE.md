# Waypoint Collection System - Setup Complete! üéØ

## What Has Been Created

Your `robot_trajectory_generator` package now has a complete waypoint collection system that subscribes to clicked points from RViz.

### Files Created:

1. **waypoint_collector.py** - Main node that collects waypoints
2. **trajectory_generator_example.py** - Example showing how to use the waypoints
3. **waypoint_collector.launch.py** - Launch file for easy startup
4. **README.md** - Complete documentation

### Files Modified:

1. **setup.py** - Added entry points and launch file installation
2. **package.xml** - Added necessary ROS 2 dependencies

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Build the Package

```bash
cd /home/sai/Desktop/smooth_nav
colcon build --packages-select robot_trajectory_generator
source install/setup.bash
```

### Step 2: Launch Your Robot in Gazebo

```bash
# Terminal 1
ros2 launch robot_bringup turtlebot_sim.launch.py
```

### Step 3: Launch the Waypoint Collector

```bash
# Terminal 2
ros2 launch robot_trajectory_generator waypoint_collector.launch.py
```

### Step 4: Set Up RViz (if not already visible)

In RViz, add these displays:

1. **Add Path Display**:
   - Click "Add" button
   - Select "Path"
   - Set Topic: `/waypoints`
   - Set Color: Choose your preference

2. **Add MarkerArray Display**:
   - Click "Add" button
   - Select "MarkerArray"
   - Set Topic: `/waypoint_markers`

3. **Set Fixed Frame**: `odom` (in Global Options)

### Step 5: Click Waypoints!

1. Click the **"Publish Point"** tool in RViz toolbar (looks like a crosshair/target icon)
2. Click anywhere on the grid to add waypoints
3. Watch as numbered markers appear!

## üìä What You'll See

- **Green to Red Spheres**: Color gradient showing waypoint order
- **White Numbers**: Waypoint sequence (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Blue Line**: Connecting path between waypoints
- **Path Visualization**: Purple/pink line showing the path

---

## üîß Available Commands

### Clear All Waypoints
```bash
ros2 service call /clear_waypoints std_srvs/srv/Trigger
```

### View Waypoints in Terminal
```bash
ros2 topic echo /waypoints
```

### Check if Node is Running
```bash
ros2 node list | grep waypoint
```

### See Published Topics
```bash
ros2 topic list | grep waypoint
```

---

## üìù Topics Reference

### Subscribed:
- `/clicked_point` (geometry_msgs/PointStamped)
  - Published by RViz when you click with "Publish Point" tool

### Published:
- `/waypoints` (nav_msgs/Path)
  - All collected waypoints as a path message
  - Subscribe to this in your trajectory generation code

- `/waypoint_markers` (visualization_msgs/MarkerArray)
  - Visualization markers for RViz

---

## üí° How to Use Waypoints in Your Code

Here's a simple example of subscribing to waypoints:

```python
from nav_msgs.msg import Path

class YourNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('your_node')
        
        self.waypoint_sub = self.create_subscription(
            Path,
            '/waypoints',
            self.waypoints_callback,
            10
        )
    
    def waypoints_callback(self, msg: Path):
        # Extract waypoints
        waypoints = []
        for pose in msg.poses:
            x = pose.pose.position.x
            y = pose.pose.position.y
            waypoints.append((x, y))
        
        # Now use these waypoints for trajectory generation!
        print(f"Received {len(waypoints)} waypoints")
```

We've included a full example in `trajectory_generator_example.py` that you can run:

```bash
ros2 run robot_trajectory_generator trajectory_generator_example
```

---

## üé® Customization Options

### Change Frame ID (use 'map' instead of 'odom')
```bash
ros2 launch robot_trajectory_generator waypoint_collector.launch.py frame_id:=map
```

### Change Maximum Waypoints
```bash
ros2 launch robot_trajectory_generator waypoint_collector.launch.py max_waypoints:=50
```

### Change Default Z Height
```bash
ros2 launch robot_trajectory_generator waypoint_collector.launch.py default_z:=0.5
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Can't see markers in RViz?
- Check Fixed Frame is set to `odom` or `map`
- Make sure MarkerArray topic is `/waypoint_markers`
- Check the node is running: `ros2 node list`

### Waypoints not being added?
- Make sure "Publish Point" tool is selected (not "2D Goal Pose")
- Check terminal for messages confirming waypoint addition
- Verify topic: `ros2 topic echo /clicked_point`

### Want to use 2D Goal Pose instead?
You can modify the node to subscribe to `/goal_pose` (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped) instead, which includes orientation information.

## üéØ Next Steps

After collecting waypoints, you can:

1. **Generate smooth trajectories** using:
   - Bezier curves
   - Cubic splines
   - Minimum jerk trajectories
   - B-splines

2. **Control the robot** to follow the trajectory:
   - Use `/cmd_vel` topic for velocity commands
   - Implement path tracking controller (e.g., Pure Pursuit, Stanley)
   
3. **Integrate with your assignment**:
   - Load waypoints from the collected data
   - Generate smooth paths
   - Execute motion planning
